# garage61-race-engineer MCP Server — Project Specification

## 1. System Overview

An MCP server built with FastMCP that acts as a telemetry analysis engine. It interfaces with the Garage61 API to fetch telemetry files for lap times, processes them locally using pandas, and returns high-level coaching insights to the LLM.

---

## 2. Core Constraints

- **Distance-Based Alignment**: All telemetry comparisons must be interpolated to a distance-based x-axis (meters), not time-based.
- **Data Aggregation**: Raw telemetry must be condensed. The server identifies braking events and returns statistics for those events, not every data point.
- **Zero-Cloud Processing**: All math happens within the Python runtime of the MCP server.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Tools must remain composable. No tool should internally chain into another — the agent (or human) decides the next step based on what a tool returns.

---

## 3. Authentication

Garage61 API credentials are passed via environment variable and loaded at startup using `pydantic-settings`.

```
GARAGE61_API_KEY=...
```

No credentials are ever accepted as tool arguments.

## 4. Tool Definitions

### `search_similar_conditions`

Finds laps on a given track/car combination with weather conditions close to a target.

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `track_id` | string | required | Garage61 track identifier |
| `car_id` | string | required | Garage61 car identifier |
| `target_air_temp` | float | required | Target air temperature (°C) |
| `target_track_temp` | float | required | Target track temperature (°C) |
| `temp_tolerance_celsius` | float | `3.0` | ±window for temperature matching |

**Logic:**
1. Query Garage61 for all laps matching the `car_id` / `track_id` combo.
2. Filter to laps where both air and track temp are within `±temp_tolerance_celsius`.
3. Return results sorted by lap time (fastest first).

**Output:**
```json
{
  "laps": [
    {
      "lap_id": "string",
      "lap_time_ms": 92450,
      "driver_name": "string",
      "driver_irating": 3200,
      "air_temp_c": 24.1,
      "track_temp_c": 31.8,
      "temp_delta_air": 0.9,
      "temp_delta_track": 1.8
    }
  ],
  "search_params": {
    "tolerance_used_celsius": 3.0,
    "total_laps_searched": 48
  }
}
```

If `laps` is empty, the agent should retry with a wider `temp_tolerance_celsius`. The `search_params` block gives the agent the context it needs to do this intelligently.

> **Note on multi-driver access**: The Garage61 API currently returns only the authenticated user's laps. The tool's output shape is designed to be identical when multi-driver access becomes available — only the underlying API call will change.

---

### `get_lap_comparison`

Compares two laps at a corner-by-corner level and returns coaching insights for where time was lost.

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `my_lap_id` | string | The lap to analyse |
| `reference_lap_id` | string | The benchmark lap to compare against |

**Logic:**

1. Fetch telemetry streams for both laps: Speed, Throttle, Brake, Gear, Steering, Distance.
2. Interpolate both laps onto a common distance axis (1m resolution).
3. Segment the lap into corners (see §5).
4. For each corner, compute all metrics defined in §6.
5. Rank corners by total time delta and return the top 3–5 where the most time was lost.

**Output:**
```json
{
  "total_time_delta_ms": 680,
  "track_name": "Watkins Glen International",
  "segmentation_source": "track_map",
  "corners": [
    {
      "corner_id": 1,
      "turn_number": 1,
      "turn_name": "The 90",
      "distance_start_m": 228,
      "distance_end_m": 342,
      "time_delta_ms": 210,
      "time_delta_breakdown": {
        "braking_phase_ms": 30,
        "coast_phase_ms": 140,
        "throttle_phase_ms": 40
      },
      "my_lap": { ... },
      "reference_lap": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `my_lap` / `reference_lap` object within a corner contains the metrics defined in §6.

---

## 5. Corner Segmentation

Corner identification uses a two-tier approach, preferring structured track map data where available and falling back to algorithmic detection.

### Tier 1: Static Track Map (preferred)

A curated JSON file is stored per track under `track_maps/{track_id}.json`. These files define the canonical turn list for that circuit, keyed by `lap_dist_pct` (iRacing's native 0.0–1.0 lap distance percentage). Example schema:

```json
{
  "track_id": "watkins_glen_full",
  "track_name": "Watkins Glen International",
  "lap_length_m": 5435,
  "turns": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "name": "The 90",
      "entry_pct": 0.042,
      "apex_pct": 0.051,
      "exit_pct": 0.063
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "name": "The Esses - Entry",
      "entry_pct": 0.071,
      "apex_pct": 0.079,
      "exit_pct": 0.088
    }
  ]
}
```

`entry_pct`, `apex_pct`, and `exit_pct` are derived from a combination of community sources (primarily CrewChief corner data) and cross-referencing steering angle peaks and speed minima from reference telemetry. When the server loads a lap, `lap_dist_pct` values are converted to absolute meters using the track's `lap_length_m`.

**Output fields when using a track map:**
```json
{
  "corner_id": 1,
  "turn_number": 1,
  "turn_name": "The 90",
  "segmentation_source": "track_map"
}
```

### Tier 2: Algorithmic Fallback

Used when no `track_maps/{track_id}.json` exists. A corner is detected as any continuous region where:
- Speed drops more than **15%** below the rolling maximum (200m window), **and**
- The low-speed region persists for at least **50m**.

Corners are numbered sequentially from the start/finish line. Turn names are omitted.

**Output fields when using the fallback:**
```json
{
  "corner_id": 3,
  "turn_number": 3,
  "turn_name": null,
  "segmentation_source": "algorithmic"
}
```

`segmentation_source` is always included in the tool output so the LLM and user know which method was used.

### Adding New Track Maps

Track map files can be added manually to `track_maps/` without any code changes. The server loads them at startup. Community contributions for common iRacing circuits are encouraged.

## 6. Per-Corner Telemetry Metrics

### Braking Zone

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| `brake_initiation_m` | Distance (m) where brake pressure first exceeds 5% |
| `brake_initiation_delta_m` | How many meters earlier/later vs. reference |
| `peak_brake_pressure_pct` | Maximum brake value in the zone |
| `brake_work` | Area under the brake pressure curve (integral over distance) |
| `trail_braking_distance_m` | Distance where brake pressure is between 1% and 20% |
| `coast_distance_m` | Distance where both throttle and brake are 0% |

### Corner Apex

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| `v_min_mps` | Minimum speed through the corner |
| `v_min_distance_m` | Distance at which minimum speed occurs |
| `v_min_distance_delta_m` | How many meters earlier/later vs. reference |
| `gear_at_v_min` | Gear selected at the point of minimum speed |
| `steering_angle_at_brake_initiation` | Steering input at the moment braking begins (indicator of stability risk) |

### Exit

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| `throttle_application_m` | Distance where throttle first exceeds 10% after apex |
| `throttle_application_delta_m` | How many meters earlier/later vs. reference |

### Time Delta Decomposition

The total time delta for the corner is broken into three phases:

| Phase | Definition |
|---|---|
| `braking_phase_ms` | Time delta accumulated from brake initiation to V-min |
| `coast_phase_ms` | Time delta accumulated during the coast/rotation phase |
| `throttle_phase_ms` | Time delta accumulated from throttle application to corner exit |

This decomposition tells the driver *where in the corner* time is being lost, not just the total.

## 7. In-Process Caching

Telemetry payloads are large and fetches are expensive. A simple in-process dictionary cache keyed on `lap_id` is maintained for the lifetime of the server process. A lap's telemetry is only fetched once per session.

---

## 8. Human-in-the-Loop Flow

The two-tool design creates a natural pause point for human input:

1. Agent calls `search_similar_conditions` → returns a list of candidate laps with driver names and iRatings.
2. **User reviews the list and selects a reference lap** (or the agent selects automatically if operating autonomously).
3. Agent calls `get_lap_comparison` with the chosen `reference_lap_id`.

`search_similar_conditions` never internally triggers a comparison. The agent or user always controls step 3.

---

## 9. Dependencies

Add to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "fastmcp>=3.1.0",
    "pandas",
    "numpy",
    "httpx",
    "pydantic-settings",
]
```

## 11. Future Work / TODOs

- [ ] **Track map bootstrapping CLI**: Build a small CLI tool that runs a reference lap through the algorithmic corner detector and outputs a pre-filled `track_maps/{track_id}.json` stub with turn boundaries, ready for manual annotation with real turn names and numbers.
